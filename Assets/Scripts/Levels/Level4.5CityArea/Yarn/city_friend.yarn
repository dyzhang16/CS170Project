		Sorry. I can’t let you in without an ID. Security reasons and all that jazz, y’know? Identity theft is a serious issue.

		You just said my name!

		Did I? I don’t know what you’re talking about.

		I’m already late for work. Let me in. Please?

		Rules are rules.  No ID, no entry.

		If Fredric isn’t worrying about getting to work on time, he’ll finally talk to me.

		I need to get Fredric his ID Card.

		Fredric, hi!

	<<Focus SECOND>>

		Oh, it’s you again. Look, I really need to find my ID so I can get into my work building. So if- If you can help me find it…

		You’ll talk to me?

	<<Focus SECOND>>
        <<SetExpression neutral>>
		You don’t have to say it like that. That’s just sad. But yeah, I’ll talk to yo-

	<<Focus FIRST>>

		Oh, what’s this? An ID card that I found on the ground by the park belonging to one Mister Fredric-

	<<Focus SECOND>>
        <<SetExpression shocked>>
		Hey, give it here!

	<<Focus FIRST>>

		And you’ll find time to slow down and talk to me?

	<<Focus SECOND>>
        <<SetExpression happy>>
		Yeah. Now, let’s go, let’s go!

		Hey, Bedford, I’ve got it! Let me in!

	<<ChangeSpeaker Player Guard>>
	<<Focus SECOND>>

		...You sure? You just stood over there and talked to yourself for a moment.	

	<<ChangeSpeaker Player Friend>>
	<<Focus SECOND>>
        <<SetExpression hmm>>
		Is that what it looked like? I had my ID all along, just...misplaced it. Anyway, see you later.
        <<SetExpression neutral>>
		C’mon, kid!

	<<Focus FIRST>>

		I’m right behind you.

	//Fred and Ghost enter office building, so they’re technically gone at this point

		Did he just call me ‘kid’? Maybe Fredric needs a day off.
