*Scene is a cemetery. It’s not completely obvious, because there’s only one gravestone, but insert typical graveyard fence and other hints of cemetery-ness*

*Ghost --insert, animation, i guess-- into existence/rises from inside the grave*

G: Whew, that was a long ride! I can finally breathe. Well, not really.

G: Where is this? I don’t recognize this place. Where is everyone?

*Gravekeeper in the BG whistling or something, walking away from grave, carrying shovel on shoulder*
//<<wait 2>>

G: Hello! Excuse me?

G: Hmm. I guess they can’t see me. I’ll take a look around for others like me.

*Player has to walk around graveyard*

G: There’s no one here. Does that mean I have to spend an unknown amount of time here by myself? Alone?

G: No! I can’t just give up without trying. There must be others outside of this graveyard. 

*G goes to graveyard entrance gate to find that it’s locked*
*Insert puzzle to find key. This is essentially our basic tutorial*
*Unlock gate*

G: Alright!

*In G’s excitement, they phase through the gate*

G:...Oh. I guess I can do that. If only I’d known that earlier.

*Go to next scene or something, a main-ish street?*
*Insert sound of crowd to imply people exist without having to actually show lots of people*

*30 minutes later, or some sort of time has passed*

G: I can’t see/feel any other ghosts in the vicinity. Now what do I do?

???: Hey, you there!

*This ??? is probably going to be the first living friend-to-be person G runs into. Is unlikely it’ll be the F1 in this idea doc.*
--Instead:--
G: There's people out here! Hello! Hey! Helloooo?

G: They can't see me...I guess I'm just not meant to interact with the living.

G: Wait. What's that? Something feels familiar in that direction! Another ghost, perhaps? There's only one way to find out!

*G goes towards the feeling, that one radar game, if we end up putting that in*
